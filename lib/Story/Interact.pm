=head1 NAME

Story::Interact - tools for writing (and reading) an interactive story

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Reading story from a directory:

  story-interact /path/to/story/

Reading story from a SQLite database:

  story-interact /path/to/story.sqlite

Reading story from an arbitrary database:

  story-interact 'dbi:...'

Compiling a directory into an SQLite database:

  story-interact-dir2sqlite "/path/to/story/" "/path/to/story.sqlite"

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Story::Interact is for choose-your-own-adventure-style stories, but with a
difference. Pages can alter a global "state". This allows your character to
achieve things, and those achievements alter the course of the story later
on. This elevates stories to a full text-based game.

B<< Documentation is currently very limited. Tests are almost non-existent. >>

Stories are written in pages. Each page is a Perl script using the functions
defined in L<Story::Interactive::Syntax>. They may contain arbitrary Perl
code.

B<< Stories may contain arbitrary Perl code. Do not run untrusted stories. >>

An example page:

  at 'kitchen';
  
  text "You are in the kitchen.";
  
  unless ( location->{apple_gone} ) {
   text "There is an *apple* on the counter.";
   next_page apple => 'Pick up apple';
  }
  
  next_page living_room => 'Go to the living room';

The C<text> function is just to add a paragraph of text. (It may use simple
Markdown for B<< **bold** >> and I<< *italics* >>.) Pages can of course contain
multiple paragraphs.

The C<next_page> function defines a path the story can take after this page.
It takes a page identifier followed by a description. It can be used multiple
times to present the user with a choice. If a page has no next page, then
it is an end to the story. (The C<next_page> function can actually be called
as C<< next_page( $id, $description, %metadata ) >> though this metadata is
not currently used for anything! In future versions it might be used to
allow shortcut keys for certain choices, etc.)

The C<at> function should be used at the top of a page to indicate what place
this page occurs at. It is an arbitrary string, so could be a room name,
grid co-ordinates, etc. Multiple pages may be written for the same location.

The C<location> function returns a hashref associated with this location.
This can be used to store state for this location. You can use
C<< location( $string ) >> to access another location's hashref; the
string match must be exact.

The C<world> function returns a hashref for storing story-wide state.

The C<player> function returns a L<Story::Interactive::Character> object
representing the player. This object contains multiple hashrefs to store
character state, including what things the player knows, items the player
carries, and tasks the player has achieved.

The C<< npc( $id ) >> command returns a L<Story::Interactive::Character>
object for a non-player character, if such a character has been defined.

The C<< define_npc( $id, %data ) >> function defines a new NPC. If an NPC
already exists with that identifier, it does nothing. If the player character
will need to interact with another character on multiple occasions, it is
useful to define an NPC for them to track the character's state.

The C<visited> function returns the number of times this page has been visited
as part of the narrative before.

The C<true> and C<false> functions are just to make your code more readable.

The first page always has id "main".
